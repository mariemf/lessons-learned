When should we use an app rather than a website ?
An app is :
-more interactive
-more user friendly
-immediate (it allows a close interaction with the user)
-more responsive and it requires less bandwith
-usable offline

A website :
-offers more functionalities, scalability 
-reaches a wider range of users
-is cheaper to build
-is more reader friendly
